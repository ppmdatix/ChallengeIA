## Goal
The purpose of this challenge is to classify images containing (or not) windmills.

## Data
Data are images (128 x 128, RGB format) that are not in this git.
We have more than 60000 images to train.
The test size is arround 17000.


## Rule of the game
The metric used is accuracay, as the dataset is balanced.

## Model
We use a neural network with several convolution layers.

## Output
The submission format is a CSV.

## Version
It runs on a jupyter-notebook with Python 3.

## Packages
There are some packages needed, but the most important one is Keras.
